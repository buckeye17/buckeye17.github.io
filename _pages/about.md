### How I got in Data Science
I'm an aerospace engineer with 11 years of experience working as a design engineer at Rolls-Royce .  Throughout my career I've demonstrated an aptitude for solving engineering problems with computer programming.  In 2018 I earned a certificate in Data Analytics from Purdue University, where I learned to use R and applied it to a variety of projects.  In 2019 I completed DataCamp's Python for Data Science career track.  This website is meant to share my recent work on public datasets and competitions.

## Environment
Python 3.6 with: Tensorflow (v2.1), Sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Datetime

All development for this project was done with Google Colab notebooks.  I made this choice for a few reasons:
1. Colab notebooks provide hardware acceleration for free.  I don't have a PC that is supported with Tensorflow hardware acceleration, so Colab saved me significant time by keeping runtimes down.
2. Sharing my work through Colab is far easier than using Github.
3. It gave me experience with Colab, a technology I had only used for my Coursera classes on Tensorflow.

Links to my Colab notebooks will be provided below.

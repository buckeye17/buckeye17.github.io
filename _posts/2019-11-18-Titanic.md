## Introduction
This was my first data science project using Python.  A conda environment for data science was created, and all of the programming was implmeneted in a Jupyter notebook.  All of the associated files have been placed in my [titanic repository](https://github.com/buckeye17/titanic) on Github, and the README.md provides instructions for reproducing my results.

## Findings
While exploring the data, the following graph revealed that the number of siblings as passenger had on board had a clear positive correlation with perishing.

A decision tree was found to give good predictive results, with an accuracy score of 77.5% on the test.csv dataset.
